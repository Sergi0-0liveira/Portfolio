-- no inicio deste trabalho a BD estava a "ler" o campo "date como YYYY-MM-DD, 
-- isto fazia com que as data ficassem ordenada por Dia e depois mes e ultimo ano. ano; 
-- ou seja primeiro ordenado todos por dia...
-- para resolver, experiment definir o tipo de data da BD com a expressão:
set datestyle = ISO, DMY;

-- Após alterei o 'data type' da coluna Date.
alter table "CovidDeaths.csv"
